### Visual representation

The `mainPanel` of your application should contain a visual representation of the `iris` dataset. The visualization can be made with base R graphics, [plotly](https://plot.ly/r/), or something less supported but [more interesting](https://github.com/juba/scatterD3). While we don't expect you to create anything ground-breaking, we do expect you to create a clear visualization with proper labels. And of course, the graphic needs to react to changing values in the widgets.
